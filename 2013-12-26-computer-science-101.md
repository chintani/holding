Not sure at this point what language I want to focus all my attention in but, I am kinda getting the feeling that python isn't it. Although I am told that python is a pretty cool language to learn ... I am just not feeling the coolness!

Computer Science 101 is currently at the time of this writing a self paced course offered in Coursera from Stanford University. The lessons are in JavaScript, which for me is the break away from Python that I currently need.

Just watch my first video lecture and learned that the fundamental equation of computers is:

Computer = Powerful + Stupid

I must say I agree. The next time you meet a computer programmer, thank them for making all our lives a little bit easier. Learning this stuff myself I have begun to realize just what goes into making the most simplest programs run successfully.

Back to Computer Science 101 -- 

Programmers Make It Happen

They think of a useful feature, problem we want solved, they think through the solution, break it down by writing code (the language the computer understands) and directing the computer to solve our problems very very fast.

Some things I will be learning in this class includes:



- The print function
- Numbers and Strings
- syntax and Error debugging

Well this is from the first video lecture anyway.
