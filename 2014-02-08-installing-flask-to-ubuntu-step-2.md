I am still on the website to [install Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/#installation) and I have completed the first step, see that [Here](http://#).

The next step is as follows:
> `$ mkdir myproject` <br>
> `$ cd myproject` <br>
> `$ virtualenv venv` <br>
> `New python executable in venv/bin/python`<br>
> `Installing distribute............done.`

I followed the directions exactly with the exception of the project name. I named mine firstproject. The results were more or less the same. I got an "extra" **Installing pip ............done.** line. Picture below.
