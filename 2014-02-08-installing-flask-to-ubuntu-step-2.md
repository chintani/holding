I am still on the website to [install Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/#installation) and I have completed the first step, see that [Here](http://#).

The next step is as follows:
> $ mkdir myproject 
> $ cd myproject
> $ virtualenv venv
> New python executable in venv/bin/python
> Installing distribute............done.



Step 2: `mkdir myproject`

		
`cd myproject`
