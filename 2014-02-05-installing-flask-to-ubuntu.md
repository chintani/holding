As I am doing this install, I am not sure what Flask is all about. My son says I need some direction in my learning to make it *"real"* for me if I build something, I agree. So if I understood him right Flask allows me to build web applications in python.

So following the install directions found for [flask here](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/#installation) I begun my journey to getting getting flask on my virtual Ubuntu machine.

Step 1:
    `sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv`

That produced the following processes as shown in the pictures below.

This concludes step 1.

Step 2: `mkdir myproject`

		
`cd myproject`
