I have been learning python for some time now and I have been using various sources to accomplish this feat including Coursera and the website learn python the hard way.

One of my major pet peeves with learning to program is understanding the boolean truth statements. I am not getting it!! Apparently to make my life much easier in my understanding what python is doing and writing computer code myself is these True and False statements (aka boolean logic).

So the "Truth Statements" produce a True or False by using algebra to compare two (2) or more terms and it does this by using AND, OR, NOT, ==, !=, >= and <=. Every worthwhile program created by man uses boolean at some point or the other so the sooner it is understood the better.

Problem is ... I was not getting it and the website Learn Python The Hard Way suggests that you just memorize the truth tables, which maybe be just sufficient for most people but, for me, that was not going to work. I enlisted the help of my son the programmer.
