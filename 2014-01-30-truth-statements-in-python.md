I have been learning python for some time now and I have been using various sources to accomplish this feat including Coursera and the website *Learn Python The Hard Way*.

One of my major pet peeves with learning to program is understanding the boolean truth statements. I am not getting it!! Apparently to make my life much easier in my understanding what python is doing and writing computer code myself is these True and False statements (aka boolean logic).

So the "Truth Statements" produce a True or False by using algebra to compare two (2) or more terms and it does this by using AND, OR, NOT, ==, !=, >= and <=. Every worthwhile program created by man uses boolean at some point or the other so the sooner it is understood the better.

Problem is ... I was not getting it and the website *Learn Python The Hard Way* suggests that you just memorize the truth tables, which maybe be just sufficient for most people but, for me, that was not going to work. I enlisted the help of my son the programmer.

The conversation with my son went somewhat like this.
> So mom you understand what I just said right?

Me: "Yes I think so...

> So if you have True and False what will you get?

Me: Uh...hmmm... and after a minute or two, True??
> No it is False.

Me: (Getting a little defensive) Well, I told you I am not getting it, I don't understand what it is I am supposed to be getting ... I don't have the aptitude for programming!!

To make a long teaching session short, this is what I learned.

1. If you have AND's and you see a false, it is false.
2. If you have OR's and you see a true it is true
3. NOT, is the opposite of whatever the expression evaluates to.

If there is still a little confusion, then maybe this visual will help you like it did for me. True is like a light bulb that is on and False is when the bulb is off. For the OR's if any of the bulbs are on then it is True but for the AND's, all the bulbs have to be on for it to be True if not it is False. For the NOT's work out the expression you are working with and when you have an answer, apply the NOT and it will be the opposite of your answer. The "it" to which I am referring is the expression that you are evaluating and to which the computer will respond and the format to which the code must be written ... in this case the language I am working in is Python.

Obviously my teaching session with my son worked and I now understand and am able to evaluate the expression and come to a conclusion of True or False as can be seen from the exercise I did below to test my understanding. I got them all right!! Thanks *Tane* for your help ;-)
