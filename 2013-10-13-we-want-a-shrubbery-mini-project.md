I signed up today in Coursera to learn Python. The name of the class is *An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python* I was a little apprehensive about blogging about an active course I am taking but it seems I am allowed to share my work with anyone, as they say 'friends' so it seems it does not matter who is seeing my code as I am taking this class.

I wonder how this works out for future takers of this class? If I can share my code with a friend and that friend at a later date decides to take this class, wouldn't having access to what I have already written put this person at an advantage over others in the class?

Anyway the first assignment entitled [We Want A Shrubbery!](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user19_RF6I1qLO9R_0.py "We want a shrubbery") was due to be submitted yesterday! I missed it. It is a good thing it was easy and also optional or my goose would have been cooked! So far I am enjoying this course ... not pulling my hair out ... yet!
