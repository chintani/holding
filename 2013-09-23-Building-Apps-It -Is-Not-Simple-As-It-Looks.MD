You look at that new App you just downloaded from the Play Store and you have no idea what went into building that App. Well I am here to tell you ... a LOT!

I messed up today ...(what else is new) and I had to delete the files from my "Hello World App" from my blog pages. Well... my little ole "Hello World App" that does not do a thing but print out whatever you type in it had ...wait for it.... 175 files that I had to delete.

The worst part of it all was I had to delete each and every single file manually because I couldn't remember how to do it in the bash ...shell or whatever name it goes by. I forgot and now I have to go re-learn how to use the program again.

The next thing is GitHub or maybe it is Git does some strange things with files and the branches on the Windows operating system. I made a little video of it that I will post later

Life is just peachy, isn't it!
