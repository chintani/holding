My son recently built me a droplet from [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/ "Digital Ocean") ... don't ask, I don't know what that is either but a trip over to their website revealed that they are a:

> Simple Cloud Hosting -- Built for developers ...
 
I guess that means I am a developer or at the very least, he is turning me into one.

So the last time I was at this droplet I logged on and the first thing I did was set up the thing to SSH to GitHub, you can view that post [here](http://tobeannounce.com) if you want of what I did.

Apparently I was not paying attention when he set up the thing and he left me to install a VNC, Virtual Network Computing. Bet you didn't know what that stands for ... don't worry I am in the same boat with ya!

From what I am gathering by the images and instructions I will be following is that the VNC will allow my computer to act like it is the host, as if the files are right there on my computer and give me a desktop so I don't have to be rolling around in terminal all the time. That is what I need. I have to see my progress and doing a bunch of stuff in terminal is not quite cutting it for me. I need that "Windows" feel even though I am in Linux.

The instructions I will be using for this project is found on Digital Ocean's own [site](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-setup-vnc-for-ubuntu-12) so this should be a fairly easy project as I can follow instructions very well (not a word on that statement).

Step One - I sure do hope I have the Ubuntu 12.10 x64 Server droplet or else this may turn into a rough ride for me. How to find what version of linux you're running anyway?

A novice question deserves an answer... so here you go! Use **uname -a** or **uname -a && cat /etc/&#42;release**

So I have version 12.04, oh boy! I am at least glad it is an Ubuntu cause I don't know if the instructions I am about to follow will work for all flavors of Linux, seeing as it refers to Ubuntu. So on to actually doing Step 1

    `apt-get -y install ubuntu-desktop tightvncserver xfce4 xfce4-goodies
`

A lot of things went on in this install, so it is too long for a screen shot of the whole thing but, I don't like warning messages as they spell trouble... if not now, sometime in the future when I am trying to do something else that is equally important as this.

Just copied the information from terminal for use at a future date. I noticed that a lot of the process of the install is missing. Seems that terminal only keeps about 325 lines of code in memory and the rest went poof!

Now on to Step Two

Well the problem I have with online instruction is that you cannot always follow it because either the person writing it have no idea how to do the task themselves or they are telling you to do stuff by memory. After I did *adduser vnc* a bunch of things popped up on the screen. After that I went to do the *passwd vnc* part and as you can see it was a useless step in this case. Yeah I am a Novice ... that just proves it!

Next part of step 2 'get root as user vnc' ... O boy! What does that mean exactly? Will I no longer use root to log in? Will root be replaced by vnc? Which one is going to give me less trouble when I am trying to do something in terminal? Are they going to be one in the same or different? Stop stalling and just do it! Here goes ...

Did it do something or not? I am going to assume yes it did and move on.

![](http://i1205.photobucket.com/albums/bb424/cybercorp/GitHub%20Images/2013-10-04_1230_zps1b60322c.png)

Would I like a view-only password? ... How should I know? When in doubt, say nooooo...

I am already logged in as root and/or vcn so I will ignore the next step and move on. So while doing this I figured out that to change users you enter "su" Now for Step Four

Step 4 ...will someone tell me how to do step 4 in terminal? I forgot, this is a hosting cloud for developers so these instructions were not written for people like me. Time to look elsewhere on figuring out how to get to the */etc/init.d/vncserver* in terminal. In the mean time I am going to cheat a bit and look for this file to see what it looks like in 
my SFTP window. Thank goodness for [Bitvise Tunnelier](http://www.bitvise.com/tunnelier), I would not have attempted this task without a pretty "window to look at.

![](http://i1205.photobucket.com/albums/bb424/cybercorp/GitHub%20Images/2013-10-04_1648_zpsfbac7e5e.png)

There is no such file as you can see, hopefully *cd* to the directory will work and then I have to figure out how to create the file in terminal and add the information required. I could use SFTP but I am going to resist the urge to and start doing things as a programmer do. I found this [site](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000773.htm) which had the information I am looking for and, which let me to the instructions on [how to use the pico command](http://www.computerhope.com/unix/upico.htm) I was able to complete this task all in terminal ... yeah me!

![](http://i1205.photobucket.com/albums/bb424/cybercorp/GitHub%20Images/2013-10-04_1953_zps4eec8c8c.png)

There is my file now created in the folder where it belongs

![](http://i1205.photobucket.com/albums/bb424/cybercorp/GitHub%20Images/2013-10-04_2000_001_zpsf6e43791.png)

Followed the same steps to create the other two files as shown below:

I highlighted the above because I do not know what to do with that information yet so I want to keep it handy for future reference.

Time for step Five, connect to the vcn

![](http://i1205.photobucket.com/albums/bb424/cybercorp/2013-10-05_2234_zps8a12936c.png)

Downloaded, installed and authenticated and voila!
